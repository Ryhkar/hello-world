# hello-world
My "get started with GitHub" repository
I am a technical project manager working on a GitHub migration
Until this project I have never used GitHub before
After attending GitHub Universe, I am setting up my GitHub account on GitHub.com and beginging to learn what the application can do
Maybe I will even try programming for the 1st time since collage.
